True Mobile:
Footer / back-to-top button are aligned left instead of center x
spacing is not sufficient for footer on mobile x
bottom line of footer needs to be split on mobile x

slideshow is still not displaying x NAILED THAT

dash form displays far too low on true mobile

also need to create the skills map. x
Need to remake the image: add descriptions to the skills map. x


Final tweaks:

Rework media queries to handle phone flipped sideways - is there a setting where it zooms in from regular phone style?
resize things on main page
publish blog post
make dash form display properly on mobile
